Here is the code necessary to reproduce the numerical experiments of:

Clerc, F., Minchew, B. M., & Behn, M. D. (2019). Marine Ice Cliff Instability Mitigated by Slow Removal of Ice Shelves. Under revision at Geophysical Research Letters.

We use the model SiStER (Simple Stokes solver for Exotic Rheologies):

Olive, J. A., Behn, M. D., Mittelstaedt, E., Ito, G., & Klein, B. Z. (2016). The role of elasticity in simulating long-term tectonic extension. Geophysical Journal International, 205(2), 728â€“743. https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggw044



The function SiStER_MAIN_cliff.m runs a single numerical experiment, taking as input:
	1. "fname" - name of output files.
	2. "deltat" - timescale of ice-shelf removal
	3. "h" - subaerial cliff height
	4. "n_flow" - stress exponent in flow law (use 1 or 3)
